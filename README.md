### Credits

* [Oracle](https://discord.gg/prHW9TA4QW), most accurate decompiler on the planet and a really fast one, for decompiling the Bytecode

## üö´ Problems

* Some files may have had unhandled control flow and improperly decompiled, which would result in incorrect table and `goto` output
* You'd have to manually fix it if possible

## üèõÔ∏è Licensing

Most of the BuiltInPlugins code is also proprietary and exclusively owned by Roblox Corporation ("Roblox"). Furthermore, any source code from this decompilation should be considered unlicensed code.
